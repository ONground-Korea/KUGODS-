# KUGODS-2022-GDSC-Deeplearning-Session
KUGODS-2022-GDSC-Deeplearning-Session is the material (lecture notes, exercises and assignments) repository for experiencing Deep Learning and making simple deep learning models with pytorch at Korea University Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC).

Since this is a short study session, we will take a quick look at Deep Learning (not deep diving..) and implement some significant models and pipelines.
